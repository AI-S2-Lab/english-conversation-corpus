[6]
okay. does everyone know what they want to do in our trip to Florida? 
well, Kathy and I want to go shopping everyday. 
and David and I want to go boating and fishing everyday. 
and Tina and  I want to go to the beach every day. 
and the zoo in the museum and mall. 
wait, wait. 
I think we have too much to do in one week. 
David is right. we should make a schedule of everything that we would like to do each day. 
okay. I have a pen and paper. I'll write down everything we plan to do. 
okay. 
okay. on Sunday we'll go to the airport and fly to Florida. we'll arrive at the hotel in the evening. 
okay. Sunday, airport. hotel. 
and on Monday can we all go to the beach together? 
sounds good. monday, beach. 
Tuesday, everyone can go shopping together. and we'll buy gifts and souvenirs. 
on Wednesday, the men can go boating and fishing. the women can go shopping again and the kids can go to the beach again. 
slow down, slow down. I can't write that fast. 
and Thursday we can go to the zoo.
Thursday, zoo. 
Friday, the women and children could go to the amusement park and the men could go boating and fishing again. 
I think Saturday should be a day for everyone to do what they want to do. it's the free day. 
and of course on Sunday, we go to the airport and we fly home. 
well, I think we have a good plan for our trip to Florida. 
yes. I've written down our plans for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and last Sunday.

I know we're going to visit your mother. that's why I'm upset. 
and why don't you want to go visit my mother. 
because... 
yes? because...why? 
because I don't know what to pack in my suitcase. 
Joe, you have so many clothes. so many nice things. 
I know that's the problem. I don't know what to take. 
Oh, Joe. here I'll help you decide what to take.
how about these blue pants? you can take them when we go shopping with my mother.
okay. and oh, I guess this red shirt would look nice with the blue pants. 
yeah? 
yeah. that's good.
and I think you need to take a jacket or a sweater because the evenings will be cool. 
well, should I take the large tan jacket or should I take the small green sweater? 
um, I think this will be enough.
you think so?
okay. the small green sweater. okay. Oh, what about what about my swimming suit.
let's see. should you take the black bikini or how about your yellow bathing suit?
I think the black bikini is better. 
oh, I like the yellow bathing suit. I think you should take this one. I really do. 
alright, okay, well. what shoes are you going to take? 
shoes? I don't know. should I take the brown shoes or the white shoes.
