what animals do they have there? 
let's see now. they have kangaroos, koalas and possums, wombats and emus. there's a lot. 
I like wildlife so that's one place that I should visit.
the leaflet says that that place is a Koala Sanctuary, too? 
yes, the New South Wales has a lot of bushfires in the summer. 
yes, remember reading about one in the newspaper not very long ago. 
yeah a lot of koalas are made homeless when the forest is burned down. the sanctuary rehomed them. 
well, it's nice to know that the money goes to a good cause. 
obviously, it's not just koalas. a lot of other animals are either killed or injured too in the fires. 
okay, this is another place on my list of places to visit. 
there is a bus that goes there every morning at 9:00 a.m. would you like me to book a place for you?

well, the hotel is located right near a boat quay. right around the corner is the weekend market. it is open right now. you could start there. 
oh, yes. thank you. I will. and after that? 
Across from the boat quay is the Opera House. you could take a tour of the complex. 
hmm, that sounds good, too. what shows they're on at the moment? 
well, here is a leaflet containing all the performances this month. you can check for availability of seats at the booking office whilst you're there.
