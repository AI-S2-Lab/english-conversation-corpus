thank you. I'll do that. goodbye. 
goodbye. 
/ 
hello. how may I help you?
hi. 
hello. they told us at the front desk that you might be able to help us go around town into some shopping? 
yes, ma'am. we offer a city shopping tour on Saturdays. 
what is the tour like?
Yeah. let me show you this brochure. the tour leaves the hotel at 8:30 a.m. and we have a light breakfast at a cafe on the main plaza. 
that sounds like a very nice way to start the day. 
from there a van takes you on a brief tour of the dog downtown shopping district and points out some of the highlights and unique shops. that lasts until about ten o'clock when we stop for coffee at the cafe George. 
knowing where the different shops are could save us a lot of time and walking. 
after coffee we were free to shop until 12:30 when we will meet again for lunch at the president park grill. 
oh, the president Park grill? I've heard of it. they supposed to have very nice lunch buffet. 
at two o'clock we travel out to the harbor district where we have a brief tour of the shopping district. then you are free to shop until 5:30 when the van returns to the hotel. 
that sounds very nice. what do you think Suzy? 
sounds great mom. but you talked about wanting to see a show. if we are going shopping all day. are we going to still want to see a show? 
Miss,would we still be able to see you show?
actually many people reserved tickets for the Marx theatre down in the harbor district. 
oh, why is that? 
well, that way they can have dinner on the harbour after shopping and stay to see the show.
but how do they get back to their hotel?
you can take a taxi back to the hotel after the show. 
what do you think Suzy? I
I don't know. I don't want to carry whatever we buy to dinner and then to the theater. 
oh, that is no problem. you can always send your bags back to the hotel with the shopping tour van. 
In that case, it sounds like a good idea. what show is playing at the Marx theater right now?
"cats". 
oh, let's do it mom. I've been wanting to see cats for a long time. 
Miss, how much with the shopping tour and tickets to "cats" for two cost? 
for the shopping tour which includes both breakfast and lunch and orchestra seats in the center section for "cats". the total price would be $325 including tax. 
can I pay for that by credit card? 
yes. you can. mrs. Rafferty, if you would sign here please.
the shopping tour will meet in the lobby and your tour guide mrs. Swan will have your tickets for "cats" for you. be sure to bring this receipt with you. 
oh, I'm so excited. 
me too. 
thank you very much. 
thank you. I can be of any help. please feel free to call. 
good bye. 
good bye. 
good bye.
