I'm sorry, sir. the prices are fixed throughout this store.
could you give me a discount if I bought both pairs of shoes? 
I'm really sorry, sir. but there is no bargaining in this store.
okay. a discount really would have helped me to buy both pairs of shoes. 
sir, if you need shoes with lower prices. I could show you some. 
no. that's okay. I'll take this pair. 
all right then. 
that will be $85.

hello, how may I help you? 
I have come to buy the new Sony stereo which was advertised in the newspaper last week. 
ah, that's just right over here. 
the price for the new model was advertised at a $179. but the price on the price tag shows $199.
yes, the $179 was for the weekend sale. the weekend's over now. 
but I came in expecting it to be a $179. 
I'm sorry, ma'am. but as you've missed the weekend sales period. I'm afraid I cannot offer you the weekend sales price. 
let me talk to the manager. 
okay. one moment.
hello, Simon. 
yes. 
can you help me with some customer service please over at Sony? thank you. 
one moment, please.
good afternoon. how can I be of service to you? 
I came in expecting to buy the new Sony model for the advertised price of a $179. but your salesperson tells me I have missed the sale period. 
see, it is correct. that the sale price was only for the weekend. however, if you purchase the stereo for the regular price of $199. what I could do is give you discount coupons for your next purchase at our store. 
okay. thank you. then I will take the stereo and the discount coupons. 
great.

Unit 5 - bargaining
[6][/]
/ 2
okay. how can I help you?

how much is it? 
it's only $375.
well, huh. that's too expensive. the last Panasonic model that I bought was only $250.
yes. well, the internet capability has pushed up the cost of phone. really, $375 is not that expensive.
well, could you lower the price to $300? 
no, the best I can do for you, is $340.
okay. I'll take this new Panasonic model.
/ 2 
good morning. how are you? 
I'm fine. how is business?
business is going good. how is your business doing? 
our business is not so good. everybody in the market is reducing the prices. 
hmm, have you lowered your retail prices? 
not yet. but when we do, we would like to ask for you to reduce your prices to us. 
mmm, how much of a reduction in price do you need? 
well, everybody else is reducing their prices between 10% to 15%.
mm-hmm, well, as you know, costs are increasing. it will be very difficult for us to reduce our prices. 
well, as you know if we cannot remain competitive, we will lose our business. 
yes, well, we understand. and we want to work with you. however, we simply cannot cut our prices by 10 to 15%.
what is the best deal that you could offer us? 
well, we could reduce your prices by 5%. and if you buy more than 50 units we can give you an additional 5%.
fair enough. 
deal!
/ 2 
hello, how can I help you? 
I'm looking to buy a car for my wife.
hmm, did you have a specific model in mind? 
yes. I'm most interested in the saluna with automatic transmission and full option package. 
that's a very popular model at the moment. the price is $13,500. 
that seems quite expensive. is it possible you could give me a discount? 
the best we could do is 13,200. additionally, we will also include $300 worth of shopping coupons at central department store. 
maybe you could throw in a spoiler and other accessories or perhaps you could absorb the cost of insurance? 
I'll have to check with my manager. please hold on for a moment. in addition to the $300 discount and the $300 shopping coupons. we will also include the spoiler and a CD player. as for the insurance, you'll have to pay for that yourself.
okay, thank you very much.
